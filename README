# Ruby Base classes for RubyMotion

A lot of rubygems require on Ruby base classes like Base64 or OpenSSL for their core functionality.
As these are not available in Rubymotion, either a full Ruby implementation is needed or a wrapper, wrapping the Ruby dsl onto native ios functions.

The goal of this project is to see if this can be done.

# Working
 - Base64 - taken from Rubinius core (BSD Licensed)

# Work in Progress
 - Openssl - taken from Rubinius core
 - Convert to Cocoapod
 - Make loading less obtrusive than it is now

# Installation

- git clone as submodule to /vendor/ruby_base_motion/
- example Rakefile

    $:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
    require 'motion/project'
    require 'vendor/ruby_base_motion/init_motion.rb'

    Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      # This allows requiring & adding frameworks.
      Ruby::Base::Motion.new(app)
    end
